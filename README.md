# Notetaking-LaTeX
Package and classes for homework, note taking, and other stuff.

## Installation
### Using Overleaf

[Overleaf](https://overleaf.com) is an online TeX editor -- think
about it like Google Docs for TeX documents.  This option does not
require a local TeX installation and is an ideal approach for one-off
projects.

1. Download this GitHub repository as a ZIP archive using the *Clone
   or download* link above.
2. On Overleaf, click the *New Project* button and select *Upload
   Project*.  Upload the ZIP archive you downloaded from this
   repository.

### User install using `TEXMFHOME` (recommended)

This will install the template for your current user in one of the following locations:

* Linux: `~/.texmf/tex/latex`
* OS X / macOS: `~/Library/texmf/tex/latex`
* Windows: `C:\Users\{username}\texmf\tex\latex`

LaTeX will find the package automatically.

1. Prepare your `TEXMFHOME` directory.

    ```sh
    mkdir "$(kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFHOME)/tex/latex/"
    ```

2. Clone in `$TEXMFHOME/tex/latex/`

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/N9199/Notetaking-LaTeX.git "$(kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFHOME)/tex/latex/notetaking"
    ```

### Project install using `TEXINPUTS`

You can also clone a copy of the repository to each LaTeX project. For example, to clone the repository to a `lib/` directory in your project:

```sh
mkdir lib/
git clone https://github.com/N9199/Notetaking-LaTeX.git lib/notetaking
```

LaTeX will not find the template automatically. Set `TEXINPUTS` when compiling your project to locate the package:

```sh
TEXINPUTS=./lib//: pdflatex project.tex
```
